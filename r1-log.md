**Planning for #100DaysOfCode challenge.**

The main focus for this round will be mastering JS. Although I use JS at work on a daily basis, I never really studied it from scratch. Now I intend to change that, and fill the missing parts in my understanding.

Things I'll focus on accomplishing:

1. [JavaScript 30 Challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)
2. Understanding and applying new features in ES6 and ES7
3. Completing the challenges in [What the Flexbox course](https://flexbox.io/)

Super excited!!
