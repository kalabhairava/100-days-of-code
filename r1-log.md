# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Manjunatha D

The log of Round 1 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on October 25, 2017.

## Log

### R1D0, October 24, 2017.

**Planning for #100DaysOfCode challenge.**

The main focus for this round will be mastering JS. Although I use JS at work on a daily basis, I never really studied it from scratch. Now I intend to change that, and fill the missing parts in my understanding.

Things I'll focus on accomplishing:

1. [JavaScript 30 Challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)
2. Understanding and applying new features in ES6 and ES7
3. Completing the challenges in [What the Flexbox course](https://flexbox.io/)

Super excited!!


### R1D1, October 25, 2017.

**Today's Progress**: Leant about git tags, MIME types. Not much progress today, not an ideal start :(

**Thoughts:** I should have started with JS30 challenge today. It's hard to make time for real coding. Now I understand why this challenge is needed :D

### R1D2, October 26, 2017.

**Today's Progress**: Working on JS30 Challenge #2 - CSS + JS Clock. Not much progress today.

**Thoughts:** CSS3 transitions are so awesome! I never really bothered about them. But when I saw Wes Bos using them to create the clock, I felt their power. I'll spend some time understanding them, and using them to create stunning visual experiences!

### R1D3, October 27, 2017.

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the JS30 #2 - CSS + JS Clock. Little trickier than I anticipated. Very exciting though!

**Thoughts:** I wish I had discovered these things while I was in college. I'm having a lot of fun. I'm thinking of creating a personal portfolio site for me.

### R1D4, October 28, 2017.

**Today's Progress**: Completed JS30 #2 - CSS + JS Clock challenge. A lot of enhancements could be made. I'll work on it later. 

**Thoughts:** Arrow functions are cool! They let you express your code in a concise way.
